## Overview
​Using my SQL2, inquirer, and console.table packages, we are creating an employee tracker that lets you see all the employees in a company as well as adding the functionality to add departments,roles and employees.
### The challenge
The challenge to this assignment was making sure that the schema and seeds were all written correctly as well as making sure all the information was entered correctly in server.js. The overall code writing wasn't difficult, it was making sure that even though the code was written repetitively, minor mistakes were not made.
​
### User Story
​Building a command-line app to help a company view it's employees,roles and adding functionality to add departments,roles and employees.
​
### Acceptance Criteria
​
-use mysql2 package
-use inquirer package
-use console.table package
​

## My process
I started by working on the schema and seeds.
Afterwards I worked on the server.js and cleaned up and worked on any errors.
### Built with​
-inquirer
-mysql2
-console.table

​
### What I learned
​
I learned that while there seems to be so much to remember, in coding with HTML and Javascript, every question seems to have an answer in Google. I thought the process would be never ending and dreaded the project a bit just because I felt like I did not have enough knowledge or experience to work on this assignment. However, I am beginning to understand that coding is like building something with leggos. While putting two blocks together seems very insignificant in the process of a 10,000 piece build. However, with a wireframe and resources like the internet as well as instructors, I think the key was persistence!
​
### Continued development
​
For continued development, I think it would be a fun idea to actually create a themed employee/company profile. I plan to make a employee list for all of the marvel characters and add more functionalities to add. I think it would be a great way to practice coding more and have fun!

My tutor Phil Loy who broke down the assignment and provided resources to reference. He walked me through with the troubleshooting for any code errors as well as helping me organize the schema and seeds.
